          We were okay okay kind of friends since 1st year but I couldn't make
          good bond with you, till u got me as a rostermate. I taught some nice
          skills which no one can teach in internship, u were actually a
          bookworm till final year and now u are totally a different
          person,person blend with both knowledge n entertainment. Do well

          You were the 1st person I talked to when we entered the college I have
          known you since that day . You are aggressive hot minded extrovert on
          the outside but you are actually calm guy from inside. You are the
          main reason I got through mbbs life smoothly.I loved spending time
          with you in college, postings and I am sad that we could not be co
          interns. I will always miss our "healthy fights" and discussions .You
          are the only person I can talk to freely and trust blindly and will be
          forever grateful for your friendship. I wish all the best for your
          future and wish you become great doctor we expect u to be

          Ever since we met, I never thought this annoying mad guy would be so
          important to me. Thanks for asking me to be your study partner else, I
          wouldn't have got such an amazing person whom I can share anything,
          everything. Your reality checks are one of the reasons why I adore you
          so much. Why do you even need a girlfriend when I am here to throw all
          the tantrums on you? Just kidding, let her be your side chick forever
          xD Also, MBBS wouldn't be better without you. Yours forever

          Hey birthday, twin! Toasting to the enduring simplicity of our unique
          bond. No way my kids are heading to medical college where your
          professor might make them suffer under you . Let's uphold the
          tradition of treating each other through life's little challenges.
          It's been a pleasure being your friend, and here's to keeping this
          bond for years to come. Wishing you continuous success and keeping up
          the good vibes!

          I have always admired how you approach difficult circumstances
          fearlessly and envied your sense of humour. You were the first person
          in this journey of five and a half years with whom i have forged a
          bond of friendship.I didn't realise how friends became bros. Thank you
          for introducing me to the world of movies and shows and also for the
          illegal means to watch itüòÇ. I fondly remember the new year parties,
          movie nights, cooking parties and the philosophical discussions we had
          in your house. You are one of the few people in my life who has
          inspired me to become the best version of myself. I'm rooting for you
          to bench 100kgs and may you succeed in the game of life.

          You're the one person in this college I can trust with my eyes closed,
          the only person whose advice I can take without thinking twice. Thank
          you for always sticking up for me, for handling my exam stress, for
          being the best friend since first year. I'll remember us laughing at
          hilarious flute fails, roasting Sahil for no reason, having ice
          cream/juice everyday xD I'm grateful for a lot of things, but
          especially grateful for pkp :)
